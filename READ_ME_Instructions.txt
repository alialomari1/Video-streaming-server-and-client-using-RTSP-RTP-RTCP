- client.cpp is the client process/app with its own RTP/RTSP/RTCP Threads

- server.cpp is the server process/app with its own RTP/RTSP/RTCP Threads

- lib folder containing threads implementation

- packet.h is the headers format for RTP/RTSP/RTCP

to run this code you need to compile -using makefile- and run the server on a terminal and the client in another terminal

Or simply you can run crun script (compile and run script)
$ bash ./crun
